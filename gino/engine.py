        Where the ``tx`` is an instance of the
        :class:`~gino.transaction.GinoTransaction` class, feel free to read
        more about it.

        In the first managed mode, the transaction is automatically committed
        on exiting the context block, or rolled back if an exception was raised
        which led to the exit of the context. In the second manual mode, you'll
        need to manually call the
        :meth:`~gino.transaction.GinoTransaction.commit` or
        :meth:`~gino.transaction.GinoTransaction.rollback` methods on need.

        If this is a lazy connection, entering a transaction will cause a new
        database connection acquired if none was present.

        Transactions may support nesting depending on the dialect in use. For
        example in asyncpg, starting a second transaction on the same
        connection will create a save point in the database.

        For now, the parameters are directly passed to underlying database
        driver, read :meth:`asyncpg.connection.Connection.transaction` for
        asyncpg.

        references the same underlying database connection, but with the given
        execution options set on the copy. Therefore, it is a good practice to
        discard the copy immediately after use, for example::

            row = await conn.execution_options(model=None).first(User.query)

        This is very much the same as SQLAlchemy
        :meth:`~sqlalchemy.engine.base.Connection.execution_options`, it
        actually does pass the execution options to the underlying SQLAlchemy
        :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.base.Connection`. Furthermore, GINO added a
        few execution options:

        :param return_model: Boolean to control whether the returning results
          should be loaded into model instances, where the model class is
          defined in another execution option ``model``. Default is ``True``.

        :param model: Specifies the type of model instance to create on return.
          This has no effect if ``return_model`` is set to ``False``. Usually
          in queries built by CRUD models, this execution option is
          automatically set. For now, GINO only supports loading each row into
          one type of model object, relationships are not supported. Please use
          multiple queries for that. ``None`` for no postprocessing (default).

        :param timeout: Seconds to wait for the query to finish. ``None`` for
          no time out (default).

        :param loader: A loader expression to load the database rows into
          specified objective structure. It can be either:

          * A model class, so that the query will yield model instances of this
            class. It is your responsibility to make sure all the columns of
            this model is selected in the query.
          * A :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column` instance, so that each result
            will be only a single value of this column. Please note, if you
            want to achieve fetching the very first value, you should use
            :meth:`~gino.engine.GinoConnection.first` instead of
            :meth:`~gino.engine.GinoConnection.scalar`. However, using directly
            :meth:`~gino.engine.GinoConnection.scalar` is a more direct way.
          * A tuple nesting more loader expressions recursively.
          * A :func:`callable` function that will be called for each row to
            fully customize the result. Two positional arguments will be passed
            to the function: the first is the :class:`row
            <sqlalchemy.engine.RowProxy>` instance, the second is a context
            object which is only present if nested else ``None``.
          * A :class:`~gino.loader.Loader` instance directly.
          * Anything else will be treated as literal values thus returned as
            whatever they are.

        Acquire a connection from the pool.

        There are two ways using this method - as an asynchronous context
        manager::

            async with engine.acquire() as conn:
                # play with the connection

        which will guarantee the connection is returned to the pool when
        leaving the ``async with`` block; or as a coroutine::

            conn = await engine.acquire()
            try:
                # play with the connection
            finally:
                await conn.release()

        where the connection should be manually returned to the pool with
        :meth:`conn.release() <.GinoConnection.release>`.

        Within the same context (usually the same :class:`~asyncio.Task`, see
        also :doc:`/transaction`), a nesting acquire by default re

        :param timeout: Block up to ``timeout`` seconds until there is one free
          connection in the pool. Default is ``None`` - block forever until
          succeeded. This has no effect when ``lazy=True``, and depends on the
          actual situation when ``reuse=True``.

        :param reuse: Reuse the latest reusable acquired connection (before
          it's returned to the pool) in current context if there is one, or
          borrow a new one if none present. Default is ``False`` for always
          borrow a new one. This is useful when you are in a nested method call
          series, wishing to use the same connection without passing it around
          as parameters. See also: :doc:`/transaction`. A reusing connection is
          not reusable even if ``reusable=True``. If the reused connection
          happened to be a lazy one, then the reusing connection is lazy too.

        :param lazy: Don't acquire the actual underlying connection yet - do it
          only when needed. Default is ``False`` for always do it immediately.
          This is useful before entering a code block which may or may not make
          use of a given connection object. Feeding in a lazy connection will
          save the borrow-return job if the connection is never used. If
          setting ``reuse=True`` at the same time, then the reused connection -
          if any - applies the same laziness. For example, reusing a lazy
          connection with ``lazy=False`` will cause the reused connection to
          acquire an underlying connection immediately.

        :param reusable: Mark this connection as reusable or otherwise. This
          has no effect if it is a reusing connection. All reusable connections
          are placed in a stack, any reusing acquire operation will always
          reuse the top (latest) reusable connection. One reusable connection
          may be reused by several reusing connections - they all share one
          same underlying connection. Acquiring a connection with
          ``reusable=False`` and ``reusing=False`` makes it a cleanly isolated
          connection which is only referenced once here.
